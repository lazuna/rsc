### The Problem
- 100 prisoners are individually numbered 1 to 100
- A room having a cupboard of 100 opaque drawers numbered 1 to 100, that cannot be seen from outside.
- Cards numbered 1 to 100 are placed randomly, one to a drawer, and the drawers all closed; at the start.
- Prisoners start outside the room
    They can decide some strategy before any enter the room.
    Prisoners enter the room one by one, can open a drawer, inspect the card number in the drawer, then close the drawer.
    A prisoner can open no more than 50 drawers.
    A prisoner tries to find his own number.
    A prisoner finding his own number is then held apart from the others.
- If all 100 prisoners find their own numbers then they will all be pardoned. If any don't then all sentences stand.

### The task
- Simulate several thousand instances of the game where the prisoners randomly open drawers
- Simulate several thousand instances of the game where the prisoners use the optimal strategy mentioned in the Wikipedia article, of:
- First opening the drawer whose outside number is his prisoner number.
- If the card within has his number then he succeeds otherwise he opens the drawer with the same number as that of the revealed card. (until he opens his maximum).
